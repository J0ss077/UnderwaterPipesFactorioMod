Port of **Underwater Pipes**, by **dodo.the.last**

### what is it?

This mod adds a new **pipe** and **pipe-to-ground**, which you can use to transport fluids through large bodies of water.

### How it works? _(internally)_

The mod creates new underwater variants of the **pipe** and **pipe-to-ground** prototypes, which are only allowed to collide with the **ground layer** of the world. Also, to prevent direct connections with any ground pipes, it checks if the placement is too close to ground, preventing it and returning the items (or dropping them to the ground nearby if necessary).

### Known bugs / To do

-   Minimal visual overlapping

### Feedback Welcome

This is my **second** official mod! Any suggestions, feedback, or improvement ideas are more than welcome. Feel free to reach out!
